# New Hire Onboarding Portal

## Project Overview
When I first started working on this project, I was a Recruiting Coordinator in the Human Resources department. I agreed to work on the project because I am passionate about design and helping new employees be successful in their role.  Participating on the project team was a major catalyst to pursuing my dream of designing cool things for the interwebs. I have since gained the skills needed to become an engineer so I used this knowledge to build out a high-fidelity prototype using Bootstrap code. 

### Project Goals
#### Re-design an existing team intranet page to enhance the global new hire onboarding training program. 
The need for this project resulted from an increase in new hires being added to the Human Resources department at a rapidly growing open-source technology company. I was part of a 4 person project team representing The North America region. I participated in the project as an individual contributor. 

Ultimately, the new hire onboarding portal that would serve as an internal toolkit to help new employees learn their job quicker and more efficiently. The portal would be a central place for all process documentation, team announcements, and training guides.

## The Design Process

### Discovery Phase
Understanding the big picture was crucial to designing an outstanding team onboarding portal. I began researching the intranet for other teams who may have created similar portals and training toolkits. I also explored the organizational structure of the global Human Resources department. I began putting together a list of people who could be subject matter experts on our project team.

### Wireframes and Mockups
I started whiteboarding my ideas and sharing my designs with peers. Once all versions were approved, I started creating a test site in Mojo to explore all of the possible features and functionality.

### Gather Feedback
The real test was to actually use the newly created site to train a new hire. The new hires would provide our project team with feedback on topics such as user experience, information architecture, and most importantly, the impact the site had on their ramp-up time to productivity. The overall feedback from new hires was positive. They appreciated having all the information they needed to know in one place. They also liked the breakdown of information in terms of WHAT they needed to know and WHEN.
