# New Hire Onboarding Portal

## Project Overview
When I first started working on this project, I was not a developer - I was a Recruiting Coordinator. However, participating on the project team was a major catalyst to pursuing my dream of designing cool things for the interwebs. I have since gained the skills needed to become an engineer so I used this knowledge to build out a high-fidelity prototype using Bootstrap code. 

### Project Goals
Re-design an existing team intranet page to enhance the global new hire onboarding training program. The need for this project resulted from an increase in new hires being added to the Human Resources department at a rapidly growing open-source technology company. I was part of a 4 person project team representing The North America region. I participated in the project as an individual contributor. 

Ultimately, the new hire onboarding portal that would serve as an internal toolkit to help new employees learn their job quicker and more efficiently. The portal would be a central place for all process documentation, team announcements, and training guides.
